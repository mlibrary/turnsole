# Turnsole

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mlibrary/turnsole/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/mlibrary/turnsole?branch=master)

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/turnsole`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

Include the **Turnsole** gem in your Ruby shell scripts that query your [Heliotrope](https://github.com/mlibrary/heliotrope) application's REST API.
  
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'turnsole'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install turnsole

## Usage

Add these variables to your environment:

	export TURNSOLE_HELIOTROPE_API=http://localhost:3000/api
	export TURNSOLE_HELIOTROPE_TOKEN=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6Imdrb3N0aW5AdW1pY2guZWR1IiwicGluIjoiJDJhJDEwJElmcTNWTUt1YVd1eTIxWVM1Rk0ucnU5RExDemZuNWRyYS54OGgwZDJhcms3dFVhTkxHNnoyIn0.67Uk4mvM_ZuXn7YpYXPIdd7ygTBKaL_Er6fx2HM_AXg

**TURNSOLE_HELIOTROPE_API** is the URL to your [Heliotrope](https://github.com/mlibrary/heliotrope) application's API endpoint.

**TURNSOLE_HELIOTROPE_TOKEN** is the [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) for your user account.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

NOTE: To get passing specs with `rake spec` you'll need to have a running development instance of [Heliotrope](https://github.com/mlibrary/heliotrope)
